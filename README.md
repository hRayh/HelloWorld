initial tutorial 
The edit file editor is a line counter.

It doesn't seem to have many formatting options, but has the hashtag active.  Let's see if that works in the middle of a line: #Goodbye World
I'm guessing it won't work there.  Indeed it didn't.  Lets try at the beginning of a line:
#Goodbye World

Maybe that worked?  Third try:

#goodbye World
did I win a prize?  Nope!  You are an idiot Ray.  That does not sound very inclusive Ray. Ray, quit talking to yourself and try to remember that all the above was typed in Spaces mode.  Switching to Tabs mode: 
Still line counting, so here is a tab:	whoaa!!! it tabbed.		It looks like a tab only inserts 2 spaces.
	pretty useless. Oh look there is a tab spaces setting.  I set it to 8 and my previously entered tabs changed their spacing (except the first one.  What's up with that?
	
	Well none of these formatting entries seem to make any differnece in preview mode.  I'm clueless here, but will lable these features with a "dumb" tag for the moment.
