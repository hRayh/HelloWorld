# HelloWorld
OK.  Due to short attention span I drifted off the Hello World tutorial script.  Now this branch is one commit behind, which doesn't sound too good right now.  Hey!!! why did this line wrap around?   I see a soft wrap setting above.  I'm going to mess with that thing.  Oh YEAH!  Wish I knew that when I went off scropt and started editing the standards of conduct page.  Live and learn super programmer to be.  Live and learn.
If you have not visited the Wiki yet, you probably should because of the important insights revealed there.  More importantly, be sure to read the standard of conduct.  There are certain things that will NOT be tolerated here.  OK I previewed this text.  What does it take to get a new paragraph around here anyway.  I will try again below this line. (That I can't get to display at all.  Too long???)

The lines seem to be disappearing.  Well despite the rediculously bad editing job above, Ray is giving up.  So much for super-programmer status.
