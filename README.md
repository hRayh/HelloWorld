# HelloWorld
initial tutorial 
The edit file editor is a line counter.

It doesn't seem to have many formatting options, but has the hashtag active.  Let's see if that works in the middle of a line: #Goodbye World
I'm guessing it won't work there.  Indeed it didn't.  Lets try at the beginning of a line:
#Goodbye World

Maybe that worked?  Third try:

#goodbye World
did I win a prize?  Nope!  You are an idiot Ray.  That does not sound very inclusive Ray. Ray, quit talking to yourself and try to remember that all the above was typed in Spaces mode.  Switching to Tabs mode: 
Still line counting, so here is a tab:	whoaa!!! it tabbed.		It looks like a tab only inserts 2 spaces.
	pretty useless. Oh look there is a tab spaces setting.  I set it to 8 and my previously entered tabs changed their spacing (except the first one.  What's up with that?  Adding some more text to this long line to see if it will trigger a scroll bar for the paragraph.
	
	Well none of these formatting entries seem to make any differnece in preview mode.  I'm clueless here, but will label these features with a "dumb" tag for the moment.  Why does this last line trigger a scroll bar, while previous long lines don't?
	
The above scroll bar starts with a tab at the beginning of the line, but this one doesn't.  Will that generate another scroll bar for this very long line?  I hope so.  Ray hopes so.  Ray's friends are doubtful. 

	Well what do you know?  A tab at the beginning of a line is something special here.  That Tab seems acts like an escape character to avoid the soft wrap feature for a long line.  This line has a tab, so it should generate another scroll bar.  Right Ray?  Yes Ray!
OK well that is good to know, but not sure how that is useful here.  This is the code section, so perhaps that is the reason.  Future Ray will say, "Yes, obviously" to this finding.
