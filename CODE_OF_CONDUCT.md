# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We pledge to always and everywhere foster an open and welcoming environment. This is a harassment-free zone. We do NOT TOLERATE the 
intoleerant.

## Our Standards

Our standards are very high.  You are unlikely to meet them; however you should always:

* Use welcoming and inclusive language
* Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focus on what is best
* Show empathy towards all

We do not accept unacceptable behavior of any sort. e.g. 

* Bad language or imagery and unwelcome attention or advances; however welcome attention and advances are acceptable.
* Trolling (or fishing of any sort)
* Negativity.  Everything we do here is positively Positive. 
* Public or private harassment.  Other forms of harrasment are OK. 
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission. Since I have stupidly posted my email address here, please do not spam me with unwanted spam. Only the kind I like.  PLEASE!!!
* Other conduct which we think is bad. Don't be bad. We don't like opinions either.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers will take ACTION if we detect unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to reject any contributions.  Sorry, but if we think you're bad, you're bad.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces. It does NOT apply in any other spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior as defined ambuiguously above may be reported by contacting the project team at rgarling@yahoo.com. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately. OMG this editor really needs a word wrap setting.  Maybe it has one, but Ray is too busy to find it.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership. Public shaming and ostracism are amoung our favorite reprecussions.
